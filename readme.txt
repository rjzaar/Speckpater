This game was first developed by Christian Coders: http://bibledave.sourceforge.net/ 
http://www.christiancoders.com/  unfortunately is parked and up for sale at the time of writing.

MAYO: http://mayostudios.org/ has developed the game over a number of Sprints and rebranded it as
Speckpater. 
Speckpater is named after Fr. Winifred Von Stratten who started an organisation called Aid to the Church 
in need which provides about 70 Million dollars of aid to help the Catholic Church where it most needs it. 
Father Winifred's nickname is 'The Bacon Priest' (speckpater in Dutch) since he provided food (bacon) to starving 
people after world war 2. Christian coders created a computer game called 'Bible Dave' under the GPL licence 
which allows us to use and modify the source code. Our game Speckpater is also licensed that way. 
The aim is to change the main character into Fr. Winifred and modify the game around the story of Fr. Winifred 
and his emergency landing in Africa. The main character goes around picking up Bibles. We want to modify the code 
so when he picks up a bible a scripture verse appears. Also occasionally the bible is damaged so the player is 
offered an incomplete verse which he must fill in if he is to keep the bible. Once we have a working version, 
we hope to gain approval for the game from Aid to the Church in Need and give the game freely to the world. 
This game development requires two skill sets. Programming in Python and graphics development.
